      Let's try this blogging thing. You will find every unimportant information
      about me here.


      Additionally you should find technical blog posts and the list of my pet
      projects as well. With time.

      I like to tinker around with code. This is my official profession as well
      since 10+ years. I'm fascinated by FE technologies and JS programming
      however I had couple of years of experience with the dark side (Java) as
      well. Usually I'm too lazy to finish my pet-projects so I need some
      incentive to be more disciplined and properly document and share the
      knowledge I gain. So that would be what this site is all about.
