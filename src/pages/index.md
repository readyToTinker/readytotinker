      Software development is my chosen profession and as many of you may know this comes with tinkering with code even outside office    hours. Since a while I felt I was missing a medium where I could collect my thoughts and share with a bigger audience. Secretly I'm also hoping, this will also help to concentrate on less but more accomplished pet-projects. So that would be what this site is all about.
