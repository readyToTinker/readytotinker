**The wonder of Stackbit.** 

During my recent surfing session I stumbled upon a minimalist little app, called [Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/). I've just read the first sentence but right away I decided to give it a try. Stackbit promised to create me a personal page in no time at all and absolutely free. Who wouldn't try that? 

After 4 click I had my page ready.

* 1. click: choose a template
* 2. click: select a site generator
* 3. click: select a CMS
* 4. click: deploy

Worked like a charm. So at that moment my understanding was the following: it uses my GitHub to store things. There is some magic (called site generator) which is most probably important. I can modify (some of) the content with CMS. My page is already accessible on the Internet. Fascinating.

I was realized that I need to dig deeper if I want to get more benefit from this. So let's dig deeper and start with a high level overview what's happening here.



**The pieces.**
