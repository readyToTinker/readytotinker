**The plan.** I was always fascinated by computer games. Back in the days I consumed multiple genre and always wondered how hard would it be to implement one. I had the plan to figure that out at one day. This day has finally come. I plan to implement a game from scratch without having any detailed knowledge about how computer games developed, so I'm ready to go through all the bits and pieces and learn it on the hard way. Of course I'm not going unarmed into this battle, I have more than 10 years programming experience with multiple languages (C, Java, JavaScript) and I consider myself up-to-date on FE development techniques and modern browser technologies. As a professional, I like to learn new things, this is also one of the driver which put me on this path, I want to learn new things. The farther from my comfort zone is the better. You should expect very technical details on everything I will face with.

I expect this project will span through a couple of months (maybe years) - depending on my free time - which is absolutely OK. No rush here, I don't want to commit to hard deadlines, I would follow Blizzard's philosophy here: "It's done when it's done". Someone might say this will jeopardize the whole project, but in this case, not the destination is the important but the path to get there. Even if you reach just halfway, you already gained a lot. The idea is to fuel this project by pure fun and the excitement of learning, I hope this will be enough to complete.

**The journey.** I plan to guide the reader through the process of implementation with a series of blog posts. In every post I start with a main challenge and try to describe the natural learning process I'm going through to solve this challenge with the best possible way according to my standards.  There might be challenges which focuses on less important aspects and possible that not every solution is actually needed for the end result. This is also fine, as the journey ultimately also reflects on my learning process on how to develop a game. I try to cover every aspect which could emerge during game development, I can't give a comprehensive list as most probably I'm also not aware of everything. The topics will be various, range from graphical design of game elements to actual coding of different game mechanics, I guess in some way all will be connected to FE development. 

Every journey starts with the first step, in our case the first step is to define what we want to achieve.
