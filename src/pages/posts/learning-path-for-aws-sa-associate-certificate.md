# **TLDR;**

This is a summary of my experiences preparing for AWS SA Associate exam. The post details the 

* learning process 
* useful resources 
* gotchas/pitfalls
* online exam experience

The intention is to help readers to get the certificate with minimal effort. Obviously, this is just one - although, it is proven - way to tackle this certificate, there are other ways too, which might fit better to your background and experience level.

# **Background**

I'm working as a lead dev since 10+ years. During my professional carrier I worked mostly on web applications both on BE (Java) and FE (JS), except for a short 4 years when I tasted a bit of telecommunication (C). In the last 3 years I turned my attention towards software and solution architecture and I'm still actively educate myself via self-learning. Because I didn't have any exposure to cloud based applications so far, getting the AWS SA certificate seemed to me an ideal challenge. I had zero experience with Amazon Web Services beside of a few architecture related articles read about AWS (and in general about cloud computing), no hands-on stuff though. I was also curious how long would it take to gain the knowledge needed to pass the exam.

# Preparation

It is staggering to see the number of AWS services at the first time. The documentation looks never-ending, the sheer amount of concepts and topics you need to comprehend can make anybody uncertain: where to start. I have to mention that there is a certificate for total newbies: [Cloud practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/?ep=sec&sec=fndl), this is meant to explain basic cloud concepts and make you familiar with AWS as a whole. I deliberately skipped this as I believed given my strong technical background and advancement in solution architecture I could spare the time. I still think I didn't lost anything with this decision.

So I made [Solution Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) to my primary target. 

You need to have a clear goal and you should build up the learning path keeping your goal in the center.

Extremely dense, you need to do notes to remember anything.

 

I used this course to fill in the gaps, especially in networking:
