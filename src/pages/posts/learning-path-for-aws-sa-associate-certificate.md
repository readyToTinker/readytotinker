# **TLDR;**

This is a summary of my experiences preparing for AWS SA Associate exam. The post details the 

* learning process 
* useful resources 
* gotchas/pitfalls
* online exam experience

The intention is to help readers to get the certificate with minimal effort. Obviously, this is just one - although, it is proven - way to tackle this certificate, there are other ways too, which might fit better to your background and experience level.

# **Background**

I'm working as a lead dev since 10+ years. During my professional carrier I worked mostly on web applications both on BE (Java) and FE (JS), except for a short 4 years when I tasted a bit of telecommunication (C). In the last 3 years I turned my attention towards software and solution architecture and I'm still actively educate myself via self-learning. Because I didn't have any exposure to cloud based applications so far, getting the AWS SA certificate seemed to me an ideal challenge. I had zero experience with Amazon Web Services beside of a few architecture related articles read about AWS (and in general about cloud computing), no hands-on stuff though. I was also curious how long would it take to gain the knowledge needed to pass the exam.

# Preparation

It is staggering to see the number of AWS services at the first time. The documentation looks never-ending, the sheer amount of concepts and topics you need to comprehend can make anybody uncertain: where to start. I have to mention that there is a certificate for total newbies: [Cloud practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/?ep=sec&sec=fndl), this is meant to explain basic cloud concepts and make you familiar with AWS as a whole. I deliberately skipped this as I believed given my strong technical background and advancement in solution architecture I could spare the time. I still think I didn't lost anything with this decision.

So I made [Solution Architect - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/?ch=sec&sec=rmg&d=1) to my primary target. Best to get familiar with the [exam guide](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate_Exam-Guide.pdf) to understand what is (and what is not) to be expected on the exam, make sure that you understand the main domains the exam covers. Also worth to take a look on the [sample questions](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS-Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate_Sample-Questions.pdf). 

*Note: There are 2 versions of the exam, SAA-C01 and SAA-C02, the latter is the only one available in 2021, main difference is that operational excellence is removed as a domain therefore more question targets cost-effectiveness. You can consult with this [page](https://www.whizlabs.com/blog/aws-saa-c01-or-saa-c02/) for the details. The importance of knowing this will be clear when the hunting for learning resources begins.*

Amazon also recommends to have at least 1 year of hands-on experience with AWS before taking on the exam, according to my experiences this is not a must.

## Domains

The exam guide lists the main domains, the questions are centered around with the distribution:

* Resilience - 30%
* Performance - 28%
* Security - 24%
* Cost-optimization - 18%

These are 4 from the 5 quality attributes (or pillars) upon AWS built his [Well-Architected framework](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/the-5-pillars-of-the-aws-well-architected-framework/). (The fifth pillar is operational excellence which was removed in SAA-C02, although I believe this gets more focus in SysOps Administrator – Associate exam).

Extremely dense, you need to do notes to remember anything.

 

I used this course to fill in the gaps, especially in networking:
