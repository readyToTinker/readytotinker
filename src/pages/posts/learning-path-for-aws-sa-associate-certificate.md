# **TLDR;**

This is a summary of my experiences preparing for AWS SA Associate exam. The post details the 

* learning process 
* useful resources 
* gotchas/pitfalls
* online exam experience

The intention is to help readers to get the certificate with minimal effort. Obviously, this is just one - although, it is proven - way to tackle this certificate, there are other ways too, which might fit better to your background and experience level.

# **Background**

I'm working as a lead dev since 10+ years. During my professional carrier I worked mostly on web applications both on BE (Java) and FE (JS), except a short 4 years when I tasted a bit of telecommunication (C). In the last 3 years I turned my attention towards software and solution architecture and I'm still actively educate myself in a self-learning way. Haven't been exploited to cloud based applications so far, the idea came to challenge myself to acquire the AWS SA certificate with zero experience with Amazon Web Services. Seemed to be a fun way to learn something new and future-proof.
